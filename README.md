# GamePadProto

Game pad and virtual arrows prototype

The first commit is adding basic game elements. (player, movement, fire bullet)

The second commit adds game pad arrows/right shoulder to fire.

The third commit adds virtual arrows/button. Click on the player to show/hide the virual arrows/button.

## Notes

Game pad inputs will not work on web/html games - only native apps. (i.e., must run the iOS, mac, or pc executable for game pad inputs to work as expected)

Virtual arrows/button should work on all platforms. The left mouse button or tapping an area on the screen on iPad (web or native app) will work as you would expect.
